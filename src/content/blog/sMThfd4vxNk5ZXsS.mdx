Hiya Guys, Gals & Non-Binary Pals!

I am currently in the process of moving this entire blog to [Remix](https://remix.run). This will take a long time, as I am kind of busy with my life, and also I am not very graphically inclined. So far, though, it seems very cool, and I hope to be able to show y'all what I built soon!

See ya' around!

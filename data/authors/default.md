Hello, I'm Alastair!

I am an independent developer from the Bay Area, currently writing random programs in JavaScript. I am also learning Rust(slowly), and thinking about learning TypeScript.

I deploy most of my code to the Cloudflare Edge using Cloudflare's [Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) and [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) products. (P.S., this website runs on Pages).

In addition to programming, I like playing creative video games(Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program, etc.), and cooking, though I am not very good at that.

See y'all around!

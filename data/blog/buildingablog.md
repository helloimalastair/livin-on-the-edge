So yeah, I have a blog now. It took me a long time to get it up and running, and honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about it.

Should I be happy with myself about the fact that I have an actual, functional blog now? Should I curl up in a corner and cry at how long it took to get to this point? I don't know.

But hey, if nothing else, I can now say I have a blog, so I guess that is +1.

Anyway, what many of y'all are here for, how I built it. Here it goes:

## How I built it

I started with a fantastic template from Github, written by the fabulous [Timothy Lin](https://github.com/timlrx), the [Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). I then hacked it to pieces, and made a total mess of it, then left it on a shelf for 3 months.

After I came back, realizing I should probably do something about it, I connected it to [Forestry's](https://forestry.io) Git-Based Content Management System, which I have some experience with. Once I thought I had everything ready, I deployed it to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), so that I didn't need to manage hosting or bandwidth. And that's about it.

I haven't set the Github repo to public. That isn't because I don't believe in Open Source, which I do. It is more just that I'm embarrased about how messy I made it.

See y'all around!
